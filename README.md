# HeroesOfPy

The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to use Python/Pandas to gain useful/actionable insights on current data for players who play "Heroes of Pymoli".

As a gaming data analyst, you would like to perform several metrics to determine how much profit the game makes by item purchases, the distribution of players by age and gender, the gender group that is likely to play the game (and purchase an Item), the age group is likely to play the game (and purchase an Item), and the top players who spend the most in the game.

From the results, we can make useful/actionable insights with regards to how we can better improve the profits and gaming experience for users.
